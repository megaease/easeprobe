## 1. Overview

EaseProbe is designed to do three kinds of work - **Probe**, **Notify**, and **Report**.

### 1.1 Probe

EaseProbe supports the following probing methods: **HTTP**, **TCP**, **Shell Command**, **SSH Command**,  **Host Resource Usage**, and **Native Client**.

Each probe is identified by the method it supports (eg `http`), a unique name (across all probes in the configuration file) and the method specific parameters.

> **Note**:
>
> **If multiple probes using the same name then this could lead to corruption of the metrics data and/or the behavior of the application in non-deterministic way.**


- **HTTP**. Checking the HTTP status code, Support mTLS, HTTP Basic Auth, and can set the Request Header/Body. ( [HTTP Probe Configuration](#31-http-probe-configuration) )

  ```YAML
  http:
    # Some of the Software support the HTTP Query
    - name: ElasticSearch
      url: http://elasticsearch.server:9200
    - name: Prometheus
      url: http://prometheus:9090/graph
  ```

- **TCP**. Just simply check whether the TCP connection can be established or not. ( [TCP Probe Configuration](#32-tcp-probe-configuration) )

  ```YAML
  tcp:
    - name: Kafka
      host: kafka.server:9093
  ```

- **Shell**. Run a Shell command and check the result. ( [Shell Command Probe Configuration](#33-shell-command-probe-configuration) )

  ```YAML
  shell:
    # run redis-cli ping and check the "PONG"
    - name: Redis (Local)
      cmd: "redis-cli"
      args:
        - "-h"
        - "127.0.0.1"
        - "ping"
      env:
        # set the `REDISCLI_AUTH` environment variable for redis password
        - "REDISCLI_AUTH=abc123"
      # check the command output, if does not contain the PONG, mark the status down
      contain : "PONG"
  ```

- **SSH**. Run a remote command via SSH and check the result. Support the bastion/jump server  ([SSH Command Probe Configuration](#34-ssh-command-probe-configuration))

  ```YAML
  ssh:
    servers:
      - name : ServerX
        host: ubuntu@172.10.1.1:22
        password: xxxxxxx
        key: /Users/user/.ssh/id_rsa
        cmd: "ps auxwe | grep easeprobe | grep -v grep"
        contain: easeprobe
  ```

- **TLS**. Ping the remote endpoint, can probe for revoked or expired certificates ( [TLS Probe Configuration](#35-tls-probe-configuration) )

  ```YAML
  tls:
    - name: expired test
      host: expired.badssl.com:443
  ```

- **Host**. Run an SSH command on a remote host and check the CPU, Memory, and Disk usage. ( [Host Load Probe](#36-host-resource-usage-probe-configuration) )

  ```yaml
  host:
    servers:
      - name : server
        host: ubuntu@172.20.2.202:22
        key: /path/to/server.pem
        threshold:
          cpu: 0.80  # cpu usage  80%
          mem: 0.70  # memory usage 70%
          disk: 0.90  # disk usage 90%
  ```

- **Client**. Currently, support the following native client. Support the mTLS. ( refer to: [Native Client Probe Configuration](#37-native-client-probe-configuration) )
  - **MySQL**. Connect to the MySQL server and run the `SHOW STATUS` SQL.
  - **Redis**. Connect to the Redis server and run the `PING` command.
  - **Memcache**. Connect to a Memcache server and run the `version` command or check based on key/value checks.
  - **MongoDB**. Connect to MongoDB server and just ping server.
  - **Kafka**. Connect to Kafka server and list all topics.
  - **PostgreSQL**. Connect to PostgreSQL server and run `SELECT 1` SQL.
  - **Zookeeper**. Connect to Zookeeper server and run `get /` command.

  ```YAML
  client:
    - name: Kafka Native Client (local)
      driver: "kafka"
      host: "localhost:9093"
      # mTLS
      ca: /path/to/file.ca
      cert: /path/to/file.crt
      key: /path/to/file.key
  ```

      env: # set the env to the notification command
        - "EASEPROBE=1"
```

Check the  [Notification Configuration](#38-notification-configuration) to see how to configure it.

### 1.3 Report

- **SLA Report Notify**. EaseProbe would send the daily, weekly, or monthly SLA report.

  ```YAML
  settings:
    # SLA Report schedule
    sla:
      #  daily, weekly (Sunday), monthly (Last Day), none
      schedule: "weekly"
      # UTC time, the format is 'hour:min:sec'
      time: "23:59"
  ```

- **SLA Live Report**. You can query the SLA Live Report

  The EaseProbe would listen on the `0.0.0.0:8181` port by default. And you can access the Live SLA report by the following URL:

  - HTML: `http://localhost:8181/`
  - JSON: `http://localhost:8181/api/v1/sla`

For the HTML report, you can use the following URL query options:

  - `refresh`: report refresh rate (ex. `?refresh=30s` refreshes the page every 30 seconds)
  - `status`: only shows the probers with specific status, accepted values `up` or `down` (ex. `?status=up` list only probers with status `up`).
  - `gte`: only shows the probers with SLA greater than or equal to the given percentage (ex. `?gte=50` filter only hosts with SLA percentage `>= 50%`)
  - `lte`: only shows the probers with SLA less than or equal to the given percentage (ex. `?lte=90` filter only hosts with SLA percentage `<= 90%` )

  Refer to the [Global Setting Configuration](#39-global-setting-configuration) to see how to configure the access log.


- **SLA Data Persistence**. Save the SLA statistics data on the disk.

  The SLA data would be persisted in `$CWD/data/data.yaml` by default. If you want to configure the path, you can do it in the `settings` section.

  When EaseProbe starts, it looks for the location of `data.yaml` and if found, loads the file and removes any probes that are no longer present in the configuration file. Setting a value of `"-"` for `data:` disables SLA persistence (eg `data: "-"`).

  ```YAML
  settings:
    sla:
      # SLA data persistence file path.
      # The default location is `$CWD/data/data.yaml`
      data: /path/to/data/file.yaml
  ```

For more information, please check the [Global Setting Configuration](#38-global-setting-configuration)


### 1.4 Channel

The Channel is used for connecting the Probers and the Notifiers. It can be configured for every Prober and Notifier.

This feature could help you group the Probers and Notifiers into a logical group.

> **Note**:
>
> If no Channel is defined on a probe or notify entry, then the default channel will be used. The default channel name is `__EaseProbe_Channel__`
>
> EaseProbe versions prior to v1.5.0, do not have support for the `channel` feature

For example:

```YAML
http:
   - name: probe A
     channels : [ Dev_Channel, Manager_Channel ]
shell:
   - name: probe B
     channels: [ Ops_Channel ]
notify:
   - discord: Discord
     channels: [ Dev_Channel, Ops_Channel ]
   - email: Gmail
     channels: [ Mgmt_Channel ]
```

Then, we will have the following diagram

```
┌───────┐          ┌──────────────┐
│Probe B├─────────►│ Mgmt_Channel ├────┐
└───────┘          └──────────────┘    │
                                       │
                                       │
                   ┌─────────────┐     │   ┌─────────┐
            ┌─────►│ Dev_Channel ├─────▼───► Discord │
            │      └─────────────┘         └─────────┘
┌───────┐   │
│Probe A├───┤
└───────┘   │
            │      ┌────────────┐          ┌─────────┐
            └─────►│ QA_Channel ├──────────►  Gmail  │
                   └────────────┘          └─────────┘
```

### 1.5 Administration

There are some administration configuration options:

**PID file**

  The EaseProbe would create a PID file (default `$CWD/easeprobe.pid`) when it starts. it can be configured by:

  ```YAML
  settings:
    pid: /var/run/easeprobe.pid
  ```

  - If the file already exists, EaseProbe would overwrite it.
  - If the file cannot be written, EaseProbe would exit with an error.

  If you want to disable the PID file, you can configure the pid file to "".

  ```YAML
  settings:
    pid: "" # EaseProbe won't create a PID file
  ```

**Log file Rotation**

  There are two types of the log files: **Application Log** and **HTTP Access Log**.

  Both application and HTTP access logs will be displayed on StdOut by default. Both can be be configured by the `log:` directive such as:

  ```YAML
  log:
    file: /path/to/log/file
    self_rotate: true # default: true
  ```

  If `self_rotate` is `true`, EaseProbe would rotate the log automatically, and the following options are available:

  ```YAML
    size: 10 # max size of log file. default: 10M
    age: 7 # max age days of log file. default: 7 days
    backups: 5 # max backup log files. default: 5
    compress: true # compress. default: true
  ```

  If `self_rotate` is `false`, EaseProbe will not rotate the log, and the log file will have to be rotated by a 3rd-party tool (such as `logrotate`) or manually by the administrator.

  ```shell
  mv /path/to/easeprobe.log /path/to/easeprobe.log.0
  kill -HUP `cat /path/to/easeprobe.pid`
  ```

  EaseProbe accepts the `HUP` signal to rotate the log.

### 1.6 Prometheus Metrics Exporter

EaseProbe supports Prometheus metrics exporter. The Prometheus endpoint is `http://localhost:8181/metrics` by default.

Currently, All of the Probers support the following metrics:

  - `total`: the total number of probes
  - `duration`: Probe duration in milliseconds
  - `status`: Probe status
  - `SLA`: Probe SLA percentage

And for the different Probers, the following metrics are available:

- HTTP Probe
  - `status_code`: HTTP status code
  - `content_len`: HTTP content length
  - `dns_duration`: DNS duration in milliseconds
  - `connect_duration`: TCP connection duration in milliseconds
  - `tls_duration`: TLS handshake duration in milliseconds
  - `send_duration`: HTTP send duration in milliseconds
  - `wait_duration`: HTTP wait duration in milliseconds
  - `transfer_duration`: HTTP transfer duration in milliseconds
  - `total_duration`: HTTP total duration in milliseconds

- TLS Probe
  - `earliest_cert_expiry`: last TLS chain expiry in timestamp seconds
  - `last_chain_expiry_timestamp_seconds`: earliest TLS cert expiry in Unix time

- Shell & SSH Probe
  - `exit_code`: exit code of the command
  - `output_len`: length of the output

- Host Probe
  - `cpu`: CPU usage in percentage
  - `memory`: memory usage in percentage
  - `disk`: disk usage in percentage


The following snapshot is the Grafana panel for host CPU metrics

![](./docs/grafana.demo.png)

Refer to the [Global Setting Configuration](#39-global-setting-configuration) for further details on how to configure the HTTP server.

## 2. Getting Started

You can get started with EaseProbe, by any of the following methods:
* Download the release for your platform from https://github.com/megaease/easeprobe/releases
* Use the available EaseProbe docker image `docker run -it megaease/easeprobe`
* Build `easeprobe` from sources

### 2.1 Build

Compiler `Go 1.18+` (Generics Programming Support)

Use `make` to build and produce the `easeprobe` binary file. The executable is produced under the `build/bin` directory

```shell
$ make
```
### 2.2 Configure

Read the [Configuration Guide](#3-configuration) to learn how to configure EaseProbe.

Create the configuration file - `$CWD/config.yaml`.

### 2.3 Run

Running the following command for the local test

```shell
$ build/bin/easeprobe -f config.yaml
```
* `-f` configuration file or URL. Can also be achieved by setting the environment variable `PROBE_CONFIG`
* `-d` dry run. Can also be achieved by setting the environment variable `PROBE_DRY`

## 3. Configuration

EaseProbe can be configured by supplying a YAML file or URL to fetch configuration settings from.

By default EaseProbe will look for its `config.yaml` on the current folder. This behavior can be changed by supplying the `-f` parameter.

```shell
easeprobe -f path/to/config.yaml
easeprobe -f https://example.com/config
```

The following environment variables can be used to fine-tune the request to the configuration file

* `HTTP_AUTHORIZATION`
* `HTTP_TIMEOUT`

And the configuration file should be versioned, the version should be aligned with the EaseProbe binary version.

```yaml
version: v1.5.0
```

The following example configurations illustrate the EaseProbe supported features.

**Note**:   All probes have the following options:

- `timeout` - the maximum time to wait for the probe to complete. default: `30s`.
- `interval` - the interval time to run the probe. default: `1m`.

    interval: 2m # default is 60 seconds

  - name: Kafka
    host: kafka.server:9093
```

### 3.3 Shell Command Probe Configuration

The shell command probe is used to execute a shell command and check the output.

The following example shows how to configure the shell command probe.

```YAML
# Shell Probe Configuration
shell:
  # A proxy curl shell script
  - name: Google Service
    cmd: "./resources/probe/scripts/proxy.curl.sh"
    args:
      - "socks5://127.0.0.1:1085"
      - "www.google.com"

  # run redis-cli ping and check the "PONG"
  - name: Redis (Local)
    cmd: "redis-cli"
    args:
      - "-h"
      - "127.0.0.1"
      - "ping"
    clean_env: true # Do not pass the OS environment variables to the command
                    # default: false
    env:
      # set the `REDISCLI_AUTH` environment variable for redis password
      - "REDISCLI_AUTH=abc123"
    # check the command output, if does not contain the PONG, mark the status down
    contain : "PONG"

  # Run Zookeeper command `stat` to check the zookeeper status
  - name: Zookeeper (Local)
    cmd: "/bin/sh"
    args:
      - "-c"
      - "echo stat | nc 127.0.0.1 2181"
    contain: "Mode:"
```

### 3.4 SSH Command Probe Configuration

SSH probe is similar to Shell probe.
- Support Password and Private key authentication.
- Support the Bastion host tunnel.

The `host` supports the following configuration
- `example.com`
- `example.com:22`
- `user@example.com:22`

The following are examples of SSH probe configuration.

```YAML
# SSH Probe Configuration
ssh:
  # SSH bastion host configuration
  bastion:
    aws: # bastion host ID      ◄──────────────────────────────┐
      host: aws.basition.com:22 #                              │

### 3.5 TLS Probe Configuration

TLS ping to remote endpoint, can probe for revoked or expired certificates

  ```YAML
  tls:
    - name: expired test
      host: expired.badssl.com:443
      insecure_skip_verify: true # dont check cert validity
      expire_skip_verify: true # dont check cert expire date
      alert_expire_before: 168h # alert if cert expire date is before X, the value is a Duration, see https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration. example: 1h, 1m, 1s. expire_skip_verify must be false to use this feature.
      # root_ca_pem_path: /path/to/root/ca.pem # ignore if root_ca_pem is present
      # root_ca_pem: |
      #   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    - name: untrust test
      host: untrusted-root.badssl.com:443
      # insecure_skip_verify: true # dont check cert validity
      # expire_skip_verify: true # dont check cert expire date
      # root_ca_pem_path: /path/to/root/ca.pem # ignore if root_ca_pem is present
      # root_ca_pem: |
      #   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ```

### 3.6 Host Resource Usage Probe Configuration

The host resource usage probe allows for collecting information and alerting when certain resource utilization thresholds are exceeded.

The resources currently monitored include CPU, memory and disk utilization. The probe status is considered as `down` when any value exceeds its defined threshold.

> **Note**:
> - The host running easerprobe needs the following commands to be installed on the remote system that will be monitored: `top`, `df`, `free`, `awk`, `grep`, `tr`, and `hostname` (check the [source code](./probe/host/host.go) for more details on this works and/or modify its behavior).
> - The disk usage check is limited to the root filesystem only with the following command `df -h /`.

```yaml
host:
  bastion: # bastion server configuration
    aws: # bastion host ID      ◄──────────────────┐
