## 1. Overview

EaseProbe would do three kinds of work - **Probe**, **Notify**, and **Report**.

### 1.1 Probe

Ease Probe supports the following probing methods: **HTTP**, **TCP**, **Shell Command**, **SSH Command**,  **Host Resource Usage**, and **Native Client**.


> **Note**:
>
> **Keep in mind that the prober name must be **unique** among probes. If multiple probes are defined with the same name, it could lead to corruption of the metrics data and the behavior of the application will be non-deterministic.**

- **HTTP**. Checking the HTTP status code, Support mTLS, HTTP Basic Auth, and can set the Request Header/Body. ( [HTTP Probe Configuration](#31-http-probe-configuration) )

  ```YAML
  http:
    # Some of the Software support the HTTP Query
    - name: ElasticSearch
      url: http://elasticsearch.server:9200
    - name: Prometheus
      url: http://prometheus:9090/graph
  ```

- **TCP**. Just simply check whether the TCP connection can be established or not. ( [TCP Probe Configuration](#32-tcp-probe-configuration) )

  ```YAML
  tcp:
    - name: Kafka
      host: kafka.server:9093
  ```

- **Shell**. Run a Shell command and check the result. ( [Shell Command Probe Configuration](#33-shell-command-probe-configuration) )

  ```YAML
  shell:
    # run redis-cli ping and check the "PONG"
    - name: Redis (Local)
      cmd: "redis-cli"
      args:
        - "-h"
        - "127.0.0.1"
        - "ping"
      env:
        # set the `REDISCLI_AUTH` environment variable for redis password
        - "REDISCLI_AUTH=abc123"
      # check the command output, if does not contain the PONG, mark the status down
      contain : "PONG"
  ```

- **SSH**. Run a remote command via SSH and check the result. Support the bastion/jump server  ([SSH Command Probe Configuration](#34-ssh-command-probe-configuration))

  ```YAML
  ssh:
    servers:
      - name : ServerX
        host: ubuntu@172.10.1.1:22
        password: xxxxxxx
        key: /Users/user/.ssh/id_rsa
        cmd: "ps auxwe | grep easeprobe | grep -v grep"
        contain: easeprobe
  ```

- **TLS**. Ping the remote endpoint, can probe for revoked or expired certificates ( [TLS Probe Configuration](#35-tls-probe-configuration) )

  ```YAML
  tls:
    - name: expired test
      host: expired.badssl.com:443
  ```

- **Host**. Run an SSH command on a remote host and check the CPU, Memory, and Disk usage. ( [Host Load Probe](#36-host-resource-usage-probe-configuration) )

  ```yaml
  host:
    servers:
      - name : server
        host: ubuntu@172.20.2.202:22
        key: /path/to/server.pem
        threshold:
          cpu: 0.80  # cpu usage  80%
          mem: 0.70  # memory usage 70%
          disk: 0.90  # disk usage 90%
  ```

- **Client**. Currently, support the following native client. Support the mTLS. (refer to: [Native Client Probe Configuration](#37-native-client-probe-configuration) )
  - **MySQL**. Connect to the MySQL server and run the `SHOW STATUS` SQL.
  - **Redis**. Connect to the Redis server and run the `PING` command.
  - **MongoDB**. Connect to MongoDB server and just ping server.
  - **Kafka**. Connect to Kafka server and list all topics.
  - **PostgreSQL**. Connect to PostgreSQL server and run `SELECT 1` SQL.
  - **Zookeeper**. Connect to Zookeeper server and run `get /` command.

  ```YAML
  client:
    - name: Kafka Native Client (local)
      driver: "kafka"
      host: "localhost:9093"
      # mTLS
      ca: /path/to/file.ca
      cert: /path/to/file.crt
      key: /path/to/file.key
  ```

```

Check the  [Notification Configuration](#38-notification-configuration) to see how to configure it.

### 1.3 Report

- **SLA Report Notify**. EaseProbe would send the daily, weekly, or monthly SLA report.

  ```YAML
  settings:
    # SLA Report schedule
    sla:
      #  daily, weekly (Sunday), monthly (Last Day), none
      schedule: "weekly"
      # UTC time, the format is 'hour:min:sec'
      time: "23:59"
  ```

- **SLA Live Report**. You can query the SLA Live Report

  The EaseProbe would listen on the `0.0.0.0:8181` port by default. And you can access the Live SLA report by the following URL:

  - HTML: `http://localhost:8181/` or `http://localhost:8181/?refresh=30s`
  - JSON: `http://localhost:8181/api/v1/sla`

  Refer to the [Global Setting Configuration](#39-global-setting-configuration) to see how to configure the access log.


- **SLA Data Persistence**. Save the SLA statistics data on the disk.

  The SLA data would be persisted in `$CWD/data/data.yaml` by default. If you want to configure the path, you can do it in the `settings` section.

  When EaseProbe starts, it looks for the location of `data.yaml` and if found, loads the file and removes any probes that are no longer present in the configuration file. Setting a value of `"-"` for `data:` disables SLA persistence (eg `data: "-"`).

  ```YAML
  settings:
    sla:
      # SLA data persistence file path.
      # The default location is `$CWD/data/data.yaml`
      data: /path/to/data/file.yaml
  ```

For more information, please check the [Global Setting Configuration](#38-global-setting-configuration)


### 1.4 Channel

The Channel is used for connecting the Probers and the Notifiers. It can be configured for every Prober and Notifier.

This feature could help you group the Probers and Notifiers into a logical group.

> **Note**:
> 
> 1) If you don't define the Channel, the default channel will be used for these probers and notifiers. The default channel name is `__EaseProbe_Channel__` 
> 
> 2) Versions of EaseProbe prior to  v1.5.0, do not support the `channel` feature

```YAML

For example:

```YAML
http: 
   - name: probe A
     channels : [ Dev_Channel, Manager_Channel ]
shell:
   - name: probe B
     channels: [ Ops_Channel ]
notify:
   - discord: Discord
     channels: [ Dev_Channel, Ops_Channel ]
   - email: Gmail
     channels: [ Mgmt_Channel ]
```

Then, we will have the following diagram

```
┌───────┐          ┌──────────────┐
│Probe B├─────────►│ Mgmt_Channel ├────┐
└───────┘          └──────────────┘    │
                                       │
                                       │
                   ┌─────────────┐     │   ┌─────────┐
            ┌─────►│ Dev_Channel ├─────▼───► Discord │
            │      └─────────────┘         └─────────┘
┌───────┐   │
│Probe A├───┤
└───────┘   │
            │      ┌────────────┐          ┌─────────┐
            └─────►│ QA_Channel ├──────────►  Gmail  │
                   └────────────┘          └─────────┘
```

### 1.5 Administration

There are some administration configuration options:

**1) PID file**

  The EaseProbe would create a PID file (default `$CWD/easeprobe.pid`) when it starts. it can be configured by:

  ```YAML
  settings:
    pid: /var/run/easeprobe.pid
  ```

  - If the file already exists, EaseProbe would overwrite it.
  - If the file cannot be written, EaseProbe would exit with an error.

  If you want to disable the PID file, you can configure the pid file to "".

  ```YAML
  settings:
    pid: "" # EaseProbe won't create a PID file
  ```

**2) Log file Rotation**

  There are two types of the log files: **Application Log** and **HTTP Access Log**.

  Both Application Log and HTTP Access Log would be StdOut by default.  They all can be configured by:

  ```YAML
  log:
    file: /path/to/log/file
    self_rotate: true # default: true
  ```

  If `self_rotate` is `true`, EaseProbe would rotate the log automatically, and the following options are available:

  ```YAML
    size: 10 # max size of log file. default: 10M
    age: 7 # max age days of log file. default: 7 days
    backups: 5 # max backup log files. default: 5
    compress: true # compress. default: true
  ```

  If `self_rotate` is `false`, EaseProbe will not rotate the log, and the log file will have to be rotated by a 3rd-party tool (such as `logrotate`) or manually by the administrator.

  ```shell
  mv /path/to/easeprobe.log /path/to/easeprobe.log.0
  kill -HUP `cat /path/to/easeprobe.pid`
  ```

  EaseProbe accepts the `HUP` signal to rotate the log.

### 1.6 Prometheus Metrics

EaseProbe supports Prometheus metrics.  The Prometheus endpoint is `http://localhost:8181/metrics` by default.

The following snapshot is the Grafana panel for host CPU metrics

![](./docs/grafana.demo.png)

Refer to the [Global Setting Configuration](#38-global-setting-configuration) to see how to configure the HTTP server.

## 2. Getting Started

You can get started with EaseProbe, by any of the following methods:
* Download the release for your platform from https://github.com/megaease/easeprobe/releases
* Use the available EaseProbe docker image `docker run -it megaease/easeprobe`
* Build `easeprobe` from sources

### 2.1 Build

Compiler `Go 1.18+` (Generics Programming Support)

Use `make` to make the binary file. the target is under the `build/bin` directory

```shell
$ make
```
### 2.2 Configure

Read the [Configuration Guide](#3-configuration) to learn how to configure EaseProbe.

Create the configuration file - `$CWD/config.yaml`.

### 2.3 Run

Running the following command for the local test

```shell
$ build/bin/easeprobe -f config.yaml
```
* `-f` configuration file or URL. Can also be achieved by setting the environment variable `PROBE_CONFIG`
* `-d` dry run. Can also be achieved by setting the environment variable `PROBE_DRY`

## 3. Configuration

EaseProbe can be configured by supplying a yaml file or URL to fetch configuration settings from.
By default EaseProbe will look for its `config.yaml` on the current folder, this can be changed by supplying the `-f` parameter.

```shell
easeprobe -f path/to/config.yaml
easeprobe -f https://example.com/config
```

The following environment variables can be used to fine-tune the request to the configuration file

* `HTTP_AUTHORIZATION`
* `HTTP_TIMEOUT`

And the configuration file should be versioned, the version should be aligned with the EaseProbe binary version.

```yaml
version: v1.5.0
```

The following example configurations illustrate the EaseProbe supported features.

**Note**:   All probes have the following options:

- `timeout` - the maximum time to wait for the probe to complete. default: `30s`.
- `interval` - the interval time to run the probe. default: `1m`.


### 3.1 HTTP Probe Configuration

```YAML

    success_code:
      - [200,206] # the code >=200 and <= 206
      - [300,308] # the code >=300 and <= 308
    # Response Checking
    contain: "success" # response body must contain this string, if not the probe is considered failed.
    not_contain: "failure" # response body must NOT contain this string, if it does the probe is considered failed.
    # configuration
    timeout: 10s # default is 30 seconds

```
### 3.2 TCP Probe Configuration

```YAML
# TCP Probe Configuration
tcp:
  - name: SSH Service
    host: example.com:22
    timeout: 10s # default is 30 seconds
    interval: 2m # default is 60 seconds

  - name: Kafka
    host: kafka.server:9093
```

### 3.3 Shell Command Probe Configuration

The shell command probe is used to execute a shell command and check the output.

The following example shows how to configure the shell command probe.

```YAML
# Shell Probe Configuration
shell:
  # A proxy curl shell script
  - name: Google Service
    cmd: "./resources/probe/scripts/proxy.curl.sh"
    args:
      - "socks5://127.0.0.1:1085"
      - "www.google.com"

  # run redis-cli ping and check the "PONG"
  - name: Redis (Local)
    cmd: "redis-cli"
    args:
      - "-h"
      - "127.0.0.1"
      - "ping"
    env:
      # set the `REDISCLI_AUTH` environment variable for redis password
      - "REDISCLI_AUTH=abc123"
    # check the command output, if does not contain the PONG, mark the status down
    contain : "PONG"

  # Run Zookeeper command `stat` to check the zookeeper status
  - name: Zookeeper (Local)
    cmd: "/bin/sh"
    args:
      - "-c"
      - "echo stat | nc 127.0.0.1 2181"
    contain: "Mode:"
```

### 3.4 SSH Command Probe Configuration

SSH probe is similar to Shell probe.
- Support Password and Private key authentication.
- Support the Bastion host tunnel.

The `host` supports the following configuration
- `example.com`
- `example.com:22`
- `user@example.com:22`

The following are examples of SSH probe configuration.

```YAML
# SSH Probe Configuration
ssh:
  # SSH bastion host configuration
  bastion:
    aws: # bastion host ID      ◄──────────────────────────────┐
      host: aws.basition.com:22 #                              │
      username: ubuntu # login user                            │
      key: /path/to/aws/basion/key.pem # private key file      │

    - name: Redis (AWS) # Name                                 │
      bastion: aws  # bastion host id ------------------------─┘
      host: 172.20.2.202:22
      username: ubuntu  # SSH Login username
      password: xxxxx   # SSH Login password
      key: /path/to/private.key # SSH login private file
      cmd: "redis-cli"
      args:
        - "-h"
        - "127.0.0.1"
        - "ping"
      env:
        # set the `REDISCLI_AUTH` environment variable for redis password
        - "REDISCLI_AUTH=abc123"
      # check the command output, if does not contain the PONG, mark the status down
      contain : "PONG"

    # Check the process status of `Kafka`
    - name:  Kafka (GCP)
      bastion: gcp         #  ◄------ bastion host id
      host: 172.10.1.100:22
      username: ubuntu
      key: /path/to/private.key
      cmd: "ps -ef | grep kafka"
```

### 3.5 TLS Probe Configuration

TLS ping to remote endpoint, can probe for revoked or expired certificates

  ```YAML
  tls:
    - name: expired test
      host: expired.badssl.com:443
      insecure_skip_verify: true # dont check cert validity
      expire_skip_verify: true # dont check cert expire date
      # root_ca_pem_path: /path/to/root/ca.pem # ignore if root_ca_pem is present
      # root_ca_pem: |
      #   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    - name: untrust test
      host: untrusted-root.badssl.com:443
      # insecure_skip_verify: true # dont check cert validity
      # expire_skip_verify: true # dont check cert expire date
      # root_ca_pem_path: /path/to/root/ca.pem # ignore if root_ca_pem is present
      # root_ca_pem: |
      #   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----    
  ```

### 3.6 Host Resource Usage Probe Configuration

Support the host probe, the configuration example as below.

The feature probe the CPU, Memory, and Disk usage, if one of them exceeds the threshold, then mark the host as status down.

> **Note**:
> - The thresholds are **OR** conditions, if one of them exceeds the threshold, then mark the host as status down.
> - The Host needs remote server have the following command: `top`, `df`, `free`, `awk`, `grep`, `tr`, and `hostname` (check the [source code](./probe/host/host.go) to see how it works).
> - The disk usage only check the root disk.

```yaml
host:
  bastion: # bastion server configuration
    aws: # bastion host ID      ◄──────────────────┐
      host: ubuntu@example.com # bastion host      │
